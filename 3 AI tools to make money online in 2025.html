                          <h1>3 AI Tools to make money online in 2025</h1>
                               <p> You may not be a tech expert or have coding skills, but you can still build a lucrative income with AI. If you’re not leveraging artificial intelligence to supplement your salary or grow your full-time business online, you're leaving money on the table.</p>

<p>Everyday professionals are finding innovative ways and use cases for maximizing the power of artificial intelligence, especially generative AI, to advance their careers and modify their income. So, why aren't you?</p>
<p>You’ve probably seen articles on the internet that cite well-known AI apps like ChatGPT and Midjourney as tools to help you make money. But what about the other AI-powered tools that are not so obvious but still leverage the power of automation to drive results?</p>

<h3>3 AI-Powered Tools To Boost Your Income In 2025</h3>
<p>Below are three AI-powered tools you absolutely need in your career toolkit, whether you’re a freelancer, side hustle pro, start-up entrepreneur, student, or full-time employed professional.</p>

<p>You may not be a tech expert or have coding skills, but you can still build a lucrative income with AI. If you’re not leveraging artificial intelligence to supplement your salary or grow your full-time business online, you're leaving money on the table.</p>

<p>Everyday professionals are finding innovative ways and use cases for maximizing the power of artificial intelligence, especially generative AI, to advance their careers and modify their income. So, why aren't you? </p>


Using these can help you make real money from the AI boom, and they’ll also help you work smarter so you’re not chasing work and trading your hours for revenue, ending up burnt out.

<h4>1. SEMrush</h4>
<p>SEMrush is one of the most essential tools you’ll need from day one when launching a freelance business. It works both ways to make money. It helps you identify the needs of your audience so you can rank highly in google search engine results which boosts your visibility and attracts more clients. This is great if you’re creating a content marketing strategy for your existing business or are a blogger. But beyond this, SEMrush also helps you create targeted digital marketing campaigns for clients as a freelance marketing consultant or marketing manager.</p>

<p>You can use the insights gained through this platform’s AI-powered ranking tools to offer and sell SEO optimization services for small businesses.</p>

<h4>2. Mailchimp</h4>
<p>Mailchimp is another AI-powered tool that many marketing professionals use to reach their audiences through email. It contains features that help you automate your email marketing, like recommending when to resend emails and analyzing your audience behavior. Mailchimp also has AI marketing tools that it hosts through Intuit Assist, some of which are still being rolled out.</p>
<p>Below are three AI-powered tools you absolutely need in your career toolkit, whether you’re a freelancer, side hustle pro, start-up entrepreneur, student, or full-time employed professional.</p>

<h4>To make money from MailChimp, you could:</h4>

<p>Build a subscriber base and monetize your email newsletter by including affiliate links, linking to your other services, or securing sponsorships and ad placements
Offer email marketing and sales funnels for businesses, based on tried and tested campaigns you’ve personally delivered using MailChimp</p>
<h4>3. Fiverr AI Chatbot</h4>
<p>Recently, the freelancing platform Fiverr released an AI-powered chatbot feature that allows freelancers to essentially have conversations and consultations with potential clients. This is based on your knowledge bank of data which you'd feed to the chatbot. It allows you to receive bookings and make money even while you are away or sleeping so you don't need to constantly be glued to your laptop or phone.

<p>Lisa Taranchenko, a full-time freelance illustrator on Fiverr, explains, “It has a knowledge base where it learns from my past conversations and my gig descriptions, and you can even edit it yourself as well if something doesn’t seem right. So that’s been amazing because I can even talk to clients while I sleep at night or while I'm sick.
For example, my daughter was sick last week and I didn’t have to worry about being on my phone constantly and I could pay more attention to her,” Taranchenko said.

<p>Don’t you think it’s time for you to unlock the potential of artificial intelligence in your own work so that you can leverage your skills to make more money? Familiarize yourself with these AI tools and don’t be afraid to experiment with them. Follow their helpful guides and tutorials so you can really maximize these features, boost your income and results, and be more effective in your work.
<h2>Making Money With AI FAQs</h2>
<h4>Can I really make money with AI?</h4>

<p>Yes of course you can. AI itself is not a magic tool, however. But combined with your human expertise, you can leverage AI tools to save you time and make money faster than would have been possible otherwise.</p>

<h4>What is the best AI app to make money?</h4>

<p>There’s no single app that has “magic” powers to make more money than others. As mentioned earlier, it’s not the app that makes a huge difference in itself, it’s what you do with it. That being said, ChatGPT, being highly versatile as a generative AI tool, is probably one of the best AI apps to make money because there are so many use cases, from creating business plans, to content strategies, to writing content, to data analysis and more.</p>
