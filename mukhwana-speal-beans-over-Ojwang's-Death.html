                          <h1>Constable James Mukhwana spills the beans on Albert Ojwang’s death</h1>
                              <p> Police Constable James Mukhwana, currently in custody over the brutal killing of blogger and teacher Albert Ojwang’, has broken his silence, revealing chilling details about what transpired on the night of June 7, 2025, while Ojwang’ was held at the Central Police Station.</p>

<p>A blow-by-blow account, exclusively in Citizen TV’s possession, now sheds new light on the events of that night when Ojwang’ died while in custody.</p>

<p>The damning statement, recorded by detained Police Constable James Mukhwana, directly implicates the Officer Commanding Station (OCS), Samson Talaam, alleging that he issued instructions to “discipline” Ojwang’—orders Mukhwana claims originated from Deputy Inspector General of Police Eliud Lagat.</p>

<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>

   <p>This comes despite OCS Talaam having publicly distanced himself from the murder allegations.</p>

<p>In his detailed statement to investigators from the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA), Mukhwana narrates being summoned to the OCS’s office during his shift. He was allegedly told: “There is a directive from DIG Lagat. Do you know him? There are officers from the DCI headquarters bringing a suspect here at 8:00 p.m. Tell the inmates to discipline him a bit.”</p>

<p>When Mukhwana raised concerns about what could go wrong, he says he was warned against questioning orders as a junior officer and bluntly told that disobedience could cost him.</p>

<p>Later that night, at around 9:00 p.m., a black Subaru pulled up at the station. Inside was a man in handcuffs, later identified as Albert Ojwang’. Mukhwana says he called OCS Talaam, who confirmed that Ojwang’ was the suspect in question.</p>

     data-ad-slot="9681146952"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
<p>Ojwang’ was booked into custody at around 9:20 p.m., and shortly after, the assault began inside the last cell opposite the toilets. Mukhwana states that four inmates—Collins Ireri, Gil Ammiton, Brian Mwaniki, and Erick Ndambuki—were instructed to carry out the beatings. All four have since been arrested and arraigned in court.</p>

<p>As the beatings escalated, Mukhwana claims he and another officer, PC Kimani, rushed in to stop the torture. Ojwang’ was found bleeding, leaning against the wall. Mukhwana says he immediately asked the Deputy OCS, Samuel Nganga, to take Ojwang’ to hospital. It was around 10:00 p.m. when he left for home.</p>

<p>The following day, on June 8, he began receiving numerous calls from colleagues asking if he had heard what had happened to Ojwang’. When he reached out to Nganga for clarity, he was advised to call the OCS. OCS Talaam reportedly brushed off his concerns, telling him “things were not bad” and that they were “safe.”</p>

<p>But by June 11, Mukhwana had been summoned by IPOA to record a formal statement. He admits that in his initial testimony, he withheld the truth as part of a pact among the officers to cover for one another. However, he later discovered he was being scapegoated by his colleagues.</p>

<p>Haunted by guilt, Mukhwana says he returned to IPOA on June 12 and asked to record a second, truthful statement. He was arrested and taken to Capitol Hill Police Station. There, he finally came clean.</p>
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-2859965243036959"

     data-ad-layout-key="-8r+ez-1j-39+br"

     data-ad-slot="9681146952"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
<p>In his emotional conclusion, Mukhwana states:

<p>“This is the truth of what happened. Ojwang’ was not meant to be killed but to be disciplined as per instruction of the OCS Talaam, who was under the instruction of DIG Lagat. I am sorry for the death of Ojwang’. May God help them to heal the loss. I know it is painful.”</p>

<p>Through his lawyers, Mukhwana has now requested placement under witness protection, stating he is ready to tell the whole truth.</p>

<p>Mukhwana’s legal team—Kevin Ondago, Clinton Mwale, and Bietta Wavinya—now say their client has instructed them not to seek his release on bail, citing concerns over his personal safety.</p>


<p>The lawyers also claim they have been trailed and intimidated by individuals believed to be police officers. A formal complaint has since been lodged at the Capitol Hill Police Station. </p>
